##  Conclusion & Insights

In this project, we explored the challenging task of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the data (with fraud accounting for less than 0.2% of transactions), traditional classifiers performed poorly without addressing class imbalance.

To solve this, we employed **ADASYN**, an oversampling technique that adaptively generates synthetic samples for the minority class. This allowed us to train models on a more balanced dataset and dramatically improved detection rates.

We compared two classifiers:
- **Linear SVM**, carefully tuned with different values of `C` and class weights to handle the imbalance.
- **Random Forest**, benefiting from its robustness to scaling and ability to capture non-linear patterns.

Both approaches ultimately achieved **near-perfect precision, recall, and f1-scores** on the balanced data. The PR and ROC curves nearly hugged the top-right corner, indicating excellent discrimination between fraud and normal transactions.

###  Key takeaways
- Handling class imbalance was critical; without ADASYN, both models struggled to detect fraud.
- Hyperparameter tuning (especially `C` for SVM and class weights) significantly improved results.
- Random Forest also offers feature importance scores, which can aid interpretability, even though in this dataset the features were anonymized PCA components (V1-V28).

### Next steps
- Testing on real-world transaction streams to evaluate how well the models generalize beyond this dataset.
- Exploring ensemble or advanced anomaly detection models, such as Isolation Forests or Autoencoders.
- Deploying as a REST API (e.g., with FastAPI or Flask) for integration into payment systems or dashboards.
